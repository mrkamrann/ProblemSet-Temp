Julie is given a string str and a positive integer val.

In this problem, vowels are defined as the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. All other lowercase English letters are considered consonants.

A string is considered beautiful if it satisfies the following conditions:

The number of vowels in the string is equal to the number of consonants.
The product of the number of vowels and the number of consonants is divisible by val.
Julie wants to determine the number of non-empty beautiful substrings within the string str. A substring is defined as any contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Create a C++ function __ that will return an integer representing the number of non-empty beautiful substrings in the given string str.

Ensure to use appropriate error handling using the stdexcept library for invalid test cases.

Input Type:

A string denoting str
An Integer denoting val

Input Constraints:

The length of the string str is between 1 and 50,000 inclusive.
The value of val is between 1 and 1,000 inclusive.
The string str consists only of lowercase English letters.
